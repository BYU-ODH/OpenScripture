# Description

OpenScripture is a open-source dataset for editions of the Book of Mormon. OpenScripture.org will provide a way to study changes in the Book of Mormon over time by providing easy-to-understand timelines for each word and phrase.

# Goals

The OpenScripture project aims to create digital editions of print editions of the Book of Mormon that are currently not freely accessible on the web. The initial scope of this project is to digitize the 1837, 1840, 1841, 1879, and 1920 editions of the Book of Mormon.

Beyond just creating digital edtions of print editions, they are also being aligned by word and punctuation marks so that variants can be analyzed.

# Timeline

The 5 digital editions aforementioned will be finished by the end of summer 2022. 1837 is currently being digitized by a group of 4 people. At the end of April, 20 people will be working on the project.

Shortly thereafter, the 1981 and 2013 editions will be added to the dataset as well. These editions do not need to be done manually, but they do need to be lined up with the rest of the data.

# Repository Files

TSV files will be provided and updated soon!
